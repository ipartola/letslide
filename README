# LetSlide

LetSlide lets you create fancy slides/presentations by simply putting in text.

Forget the layout, just type in the content. LetSlide will do the rest: transform the markdown into slides and give you a link to the full presentation.

Check it out at http://letslide.com.

# HTML5 Presentation

What you get is an HTML5 Presentation (http://slides.html5rocks.com/).

You can instantly share the slides with anyone in the world. Just send them a link.
